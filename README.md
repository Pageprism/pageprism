# Pageshare

Pageshare *aka Pageprism*, is a software for redefining the book - making outcome atoms but keeping storage, distribution 
and showrooming in bit side.  The code is for the showrooming and connecting to on demand printing and social media. The 
platform is designed by Luisa-Claudia Sovij√§rvi with help of many others shown in the principles.
  
Pageshare implemented using Laravel framework, for running and setting up the project follow the standard 
Laravel instructions and guides at [official Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8). Release of version 2.x obsoletes the 
legacy Pageshare system which was implemented over CodeIgniter framework.
